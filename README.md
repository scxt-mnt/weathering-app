# Weathering App 🌦️

Weathering App is a modern and interactive weather application that not only provides accurate weather updates but also **displays dynamic animations based on the current weather conditions**. It’s designed to make checking the weather a visually engaging experience.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Updates** – Get accurate weather data for your current location or any city worldwide.  
- **Dynamic Animations** – Backgrounds and effects change according to the weather (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy, snowing).  
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Clean, intuitive, and responsive design for desktop and mobile.  
- **Search Functionality** – Easily check the weather of any location by entering the city name.  
- **Responsive Design** – Works seamlessly on different devices and screen sizes.  

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)  
- Animation libraries (optional, e.g., GSAP, Lottie)  

## How It Works

1. User opens the app and allows location access (optional).  
2. Weather data is fetched from the API for the current location or searched city.  
3. Background animations dynamically change based on the retrieved weather condition.
